### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I need an API key?

No. You just need to insert your crypto address of the cryptocurrencies you wish to accept. Whenever a customer pays, the money will be automatically and instantly forwarded to your address.

#### How long do payments take before they're confirmed?

This depends on the cryptocurrency you're using. Bitcoin usually takes up to 11 minutes, Ethereum usually takes less than a minute.

#### Is there a minimum for a payment?

Yes, the minimums change according to the chosen cryptocurrency and can be checked [here](https://blockbee.io/cryptocurrencies).
If the OpenCart order total is below the chosen cryptocurrency's minimum, an error is raised to the user.
